# Supreme Wisdom 

All things being equal = Everything happens as expected

### No Ego

Ego = 1 / Knowledge
Albert Einstein: "More the knowledge lesser the Ego, lesser the knowledge, more the Ego".

### No Personality 

Albert Einstein:"We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."

### No Being  

### No Life


```python
import math
class Supreme_Wisdon
    
    knowlege = math.inf
    
    def __init__(self):
        print('All things being equal = Everything happens as expected')
    
    def ego(knowledge):
        return 1/knowlege

    def power():
        return knowlege
    
    def personality():
        return 1/power
    
    def being():
        return 1/knowlege
    
    def time_frame():
        return float(knowlege)
        
    def life():
        return 1/time_frame
